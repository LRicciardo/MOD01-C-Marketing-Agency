## Description<center><font color="blue">**Description**</font></center>
(Refactor Challenge) Horiseon Website needs to upgrade their website to include online accessibilty functions. My goal is to provide thoses HTML elements. I have also added some comments and made the CSS stylesheet more efficient and less cumbersome.
 
## User Story

```md
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Mock-Up

The following image was provided to show the web application's appearance and functionality:
